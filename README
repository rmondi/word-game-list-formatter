# Word Game List Formatter #

## Description ##
This package allows you to create a list of words in JSON format from a source text file, intended for use in a word game. The source file should contain one word per line. The package performs the following steps for each word:
* __Accent removal:__ Accented characters are replaced with their non-accented equivalents.
* __Uppercasing:__ Each word is converted to uppercase letters.

The final result is a JSON file containing a list of words, optimized for use in word games such as crosswords, Scrabble, or similar games.

## Example usage ##
* __Input:__ A text file with words like "élève", "forêt", "français".
* __Output:__ A JSON file with words like "ELEVE", "FORET", "FRANCAIS".

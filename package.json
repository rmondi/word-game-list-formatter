  "description": "This package allows you to create a list of words in JSON format from a source text file, intended for use in a word game. The source file should contain one word per line. The package performs the following steps for each word: Accent removal: 1. Accented characters are replaced with their non-accented equivalents. 2. Uppercasing: Each word is converted to uppercase letters. The final result is a JSON file containing a list of words, optimized for use in word games such as crosswords, Scrabble, or similar games.",
